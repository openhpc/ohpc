### Community building blocks for HPC systems 


#### Introduction

This stack provides a variety of common, pre-built ingredients required to
deploy and manage an HPC Linux cluster including provisioning tools, resource
management, I/O clients, runtimes, development tools, containers, and a variety of
scientific libraries.

There are currently two release series: [1.3.x](https://github.com/openhpc/ohpc/wiki/1.3.9) and [2.x](https://github.com/openhpc/ohpc/wiki/2.x)


#### Getting started

OpenHPC provides pre-built binaries via repositories for use with standard
Linux package manager tools (e.g. ```yum``` or ```zypper```). To get started, you
can enable an OpenHPC repository locally through installation of an
```ohpc-release``` RPM which includes gpg keys for package signing and defines
the URL locations for [base] and [update] package repositories. Installation guides 
tailored for each supported provisioning system and resource manager are also available.  Copies of the
```ohpc-release``` package and installation guides along with more information is available on the relevant release series pages ([1.3.x](https://github.com/openhpc/ohpc/wiki/1.3.9) or [2.x](https://github.com/openhpc/ohpc/wiki/2.x)).
