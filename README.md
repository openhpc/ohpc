### Community building blocks for HPC systems 


#### Introduction

This stack provides a variety of common, pre-built ingredients required to
deploy and manage an HPC Linux cluster including provisioning tools, resource
management, I/O clients, runtimes, development tools, containers, and a variety of
scientific libraries.

There are currently two release series:
[1.3.x](https://github.com/openhpc/ohpc/wiki/1.3.9) and
[2.x](https://github.com/openhpc/ohpc/wiki/2.x), which target different major
Linux OS distributions. The 1.3.x series targets CentOS7 and SLES12 while the
2.x series targets CentOS8 and Leap15.


#### Getting started

OpenHPC provides pre-built binaries via repositories for use with standard
Linux package manager tools (e.g. ```yum``` or ```zypper```). To get started,
you can enable an OpenHPC repository locally through installation of an
```ohpc-release``` RPM which includes gpg keys for package signing and defines
the URL locations for [base] and [update] package repositories. Installation
guides tailored for each supported provisioning system and resource manager
with detailed example instructions for installaing a cluster are also available.
Copies of the ```ohpc-release``` package and installation guides along with
more information is available on the relevant release series pages
([1.3.x](https://github.com/openhpc/ohpc/wiki/1.3.9) or
[2.x](https://github.com/openhpc/ohpc/wiki/2.x)).
