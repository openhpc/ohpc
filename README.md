## Community building blocks for HPC systems

### Introduction

This stack provides a variety of common, pre-built ingredients required to
deploy and manage an HPC Linux cluster including provisioning tools, resource
management, I/O clients, runtimes, development tools, containers, and a variety of
scientific libraries.

There are currently three release series: [1.3.x][13xbranch], [2.x][2xbranch] and
[3.x][3xbranch], which target different major Linux OS distributions:

- The 1.3.x series targets CentOS7 and SLES12.
- The 2.x series targets CentOS8 and Leap15.
- The 3.x series targets EL9, Leap 15 and openEuler 22.03.

### Getting started

OpenHPC provides pre-built binaries via repositories for use with standard
Linux package manager tools (e.g. ```yum``` or ```zypper```). To get started,
you can enable an OpenHPC repository locally through installation of an
```ohpc-release``` RPM which includes gpg keys for package signing and defines
the URL locations for [base] and [update] package repositories. Installation
guides tailored for each supported provisioning system and resource manager
with detailed example instructions for installing a cluster are also available.
Copies of the ```ohpc-release``` package and installation guides along with
more information is available on the relevant release series pages
([1.3.x][13xbranch], [2.x][2xbranch] or [3.x][3xbranch]).
