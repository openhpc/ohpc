\subsection{Installation template}
The collection of command-line instructions that follow in this guide, when
combined with local site inputs, can be used to implement a 
bare-metal system installation and configuration. The format of these commands
is intended to be usable via direct cut and paste (with variable substitution
for site-specific settings). Alternatively, the \OHPC{} documentation package
(\texttt{docs-ohpc}) includes a template script which includes a summary of all 
of the commands used herein. This script can be used in conjunction with a 
simple text file to define the local site variables defined in the previous 
section (\S~\ref{sec:inputs}) and is provided as a convenience for 
administrators. For additional information on accessing this script, please see
Appendix~\ref{appendix:template_script}.
