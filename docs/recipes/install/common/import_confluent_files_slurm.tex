\noindent Similarly, to import the
%global Slurm configuration file and the
cryptographic
key
%and associated file permissions
that is required by the {\em munge}
authentication library to be available on every host in the resource management
pool, issue the following:

% begin_ohpc_run
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,literate={-}{-}1,keywords={},upquote=true]
[sms](*\#*) echo "/etc/munge/munge.key -> /etc/munge/munge.key" >> /var/lib/confluent/public/os/rocky-9.4-x86_64-default
\end{lstlisting}
% \end_ohpc_run

The ``\texttt{nodeapply compute -F}'' command can be used to distribute changes made to any
defined synchronization files on the SMS host. Users wishing to automate this process may
want to consider adding a crontab entry to perform this action at defined intervals.
