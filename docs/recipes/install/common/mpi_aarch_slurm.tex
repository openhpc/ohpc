For MPI development and runtime support, \OHPC{} provides pre-packaged builds
for two MPI families that are compatible with both ethernet and high-speed
fabrics.  These MPI stacks can be installed as follows:

% begin_ohpc_run
% ohpc_comment_header Install MPI Stacks \ref{sec:mpi}
% ohpc_command if [[ ${enable_mpi_defaults} -eq 1 ]];then
% ohpc_indent 5
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
[sms](*\#*) (*\install*) openmpi5-pmix-gnu14-ohpc mpich-ofi-gnu14-ohpc
\end{lstlisting}
% ohpc_indent 0
% ohpc_command fi
% end_ohpc_run

Note that OpenHPC 2.x introduces the use of two related transport layers for
the MPICH and OpenMPI builds that support a variety of underlying
fabrics: \href{https://www.openucx.org}{UCX} (Unified Communication X)
and \href{https://ofiwg.github.io/libfabric/}{OFI} (OpenFabrics interfaces).
In the case of OpenMPI, a monolithic build is provided which supports both
transports and end-users can customize their runtime preferences with
environment variables. For MPICH, two separate builds are provided and the
example above highlighted installing the {\texttt ofi} variant.  However, the
packaging is designed such that both versions can be installed simultaneously
and users can switch between the two via normal module command
semantics. Alternatively, a site can choose to install the {\texttt ucx} variant
instead as a drop-in MPICH replacement:

% begin_ohpc_run
% ohpc_command if [[ ${enable_mpich_ucx} -eq 1 ]];then
% ohpc_indent 5
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
[sms](*\#*) (*\install*) mpich-ucx-gnu14-ohpc
\end{lstlisting}
% ohpc_indent 0
% ohpc_command fi
% end_ohpc_run

In the case where both MPICH variants are installed, two modules will be
visible in the end-user environment and an example of this configuration is
highlighted is below.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
[sms](*\#*) module avail mpich

-------------------- /opt/ohpc/pub/moduledeps/gnu14 ---------------------
   mpich/3.4.3-ofi    mpich/3.4.3-ucx (D)
\end{lstlisting}
