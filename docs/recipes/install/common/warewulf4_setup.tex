At this point, all of the packages necessary to use \Warewulf{} on the {\em

support local provisioning using a second private interface (refer to
Figure~\ref{fig:physical_arch}).

provision over the \texttt{eth1} interface and the steps below include updating
this setting to override with a potentially alternatively-named interface specified by
\texttt{\$\{sms\_eth\_internal\}}.
