In order to utilize \InfiniBand{} as the underlying high speed interconnect, it is
generally necessary to increase the locked memory settings for system
users. This can be accomplished by updating
the \texttt{/etc/security/limits.conf} file and this should be performed within
the {{\em compute} image and on all job submission hosts. In this recipe, jobs
are submitted from the {\em master} host, and the following commands can be
used to update the maximum locked memory settings on both the master host and
the compute image:

% begin_ohpc_run
% ohpc_comment_header Additional customizations \ref{sec:addl_customizations}
