In order to utilize \InfiniBand{} or Omni-Path as the underlying high speed interconnect, it is
generally necessary to increase the locked memory settings for system
users. This can be accomplished by updating
the \texttt{/etc/security/limits.conf} file and this should be performed within
the {{\em compute} image and on all job submission hosts. In this recipe, jobs
are submitted from the {\em master} host, and the following commands can be
used to update the maximum locked memory settings on both the master host and
the compute image:

% begin_ohpc_run
% ohpc_validation_newline 
% ohpc_validation_comment Update memlock settings
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,keywords={},upquote=true]
# Update memlock settings on master
[sms](*\#*) perl -pi -e 's/# End of file/\* soft memlock unlimited\n$&/s' /etc/security/limits.conf
[sms](*\#*) perl -pi -e 's/# End of file/\* hard memlock unlimited\n$&/s' /etc/security/limits.conf

# Update memlock settings within compute image
[sms](*\#*) perl -pi -e 's/# End of file/\* soft memlock unlimited\n$&/s' $CHROOT/etc/security/limits.conf
[sms](*\#*) perl -pi -e 's/# End of file/\* hard memlock unlimited\n$&/s' $CHROOT/etc/security/limits.conf
\end{lstlisting}
% end_ohpc_run
