\OHPC{}-provided 3rd party builds are configured to be installed
into a common top-level repository so that they can be easily exported to
desired hosts within the cluster. This common top-level path
(\path{/opt/ohpc/pub}) was previously configured to be mounted on {\em
 compute} nodes in \S\ref{sec:master_customization}, so the packages will be
immediately available for use on the cluster after installation on the {\em
 master} host.

For convenience, \OHPC{} provides package aliases for these 3rd party libraries
and utilities that can be used to install available libraries for use with the
GNU compiler family toolchain. For parallel libraries, aliases are grouped by
MPI family toolchain so that administrators can choose a subset should they
favor a particular MPI stack.  Please refer to Appendix~\ref{appendix:manifest}
for a more detailed listing of all available packages in each of these functional
areas. To install all available package offerings within \OHPC{}, issue the
following:
