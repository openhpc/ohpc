\subsection{Package Signatures}
%\addcontentsline{toc}{section}{Appendix B - Package Signatures}

All of the RPMs provided via the \OHPC{} repository are signed with a GPG
signature. By default, the underlying package managers will verify these signatures during
installation to ensure that packages have not been altered. The RPMs can also
be manually verified and the public signing key fingerprint for the latest
repository is shown below: \\

\texttt{Fingerprint: 5392 744D 3C54 3ED5 7847  65E6 8A30 6019 {\bf DA565C6C}} \\

\noindent The following command can be used to verify an RPM once it
has been downloaded locally by confirming if the package is signed, and if so,
indicating which key was used to sign it. The example below highlights usage
for a local copy of the \texttt{docs-ohpc} package and illustrates how the {\em
key ID} matches the fingerprint shown above.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,keywords={}]
[sms](*\#*) rpm --checksig -v docs-ohpc-*.rpm
docs-ohpc-2.0.0-72.1.ohpc.2.0.x86_64.rpm:

    Header SHA1 digest: OK
