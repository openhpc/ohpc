\mrsh{} is a secure remote shell utility, like {\em ssh}, which uses
\MUNGE{} for authentication and encryption. By using the \MUNGE{}
installation used by \SLURM{}, \mrsh{} provides passwordless shell
access on systems using the same \MUNGE{} key without having to track
{\em ssh} keys. Like {\em ssh}, \mrsh{} provides a remote copy command,
{\em mrcp}, and can be used as a {\em rcmd} by {\em pdsh}.
