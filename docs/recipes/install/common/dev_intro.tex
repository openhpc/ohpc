The install procedure outlined in \S\ref{sec:basic_install} highlighted the
steps necessary to install a {\em master} host, assemble and customize a {\em
  compute} image, and provision several compute hosts from bare-metal. With
these steps completed, additional \OHPC{}-provided packages can now be added to
support a flexible HPC development environment including development tools,
C/C++/Fortran compilers, MPI stacks, and a variety of 3rd party libraries. The
following subsections highlight the additional software installation
procedures, including the addition of Intel licensed software (e.g. Composer
compiler suite, \Intel{} MPI). It is assumed that the end-site administrator
will procure and install the necessary licenses in order to use the Intel
proprietary software.
