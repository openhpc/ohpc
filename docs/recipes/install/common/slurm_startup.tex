In section \S\ref{sec:basic_install}, the \SLURM{} resource manager was installed
and configured for use on both the {\em master} host and {\em compute} node
instances. With the cluster nodes up and functional, we can now startup the
resource manager services in preparation for running user jobs. Generally, this
is a two-step process that requires starting up the controller daemons on the {\em
 master} host and the client daemons on each of the {\em compute} hosts.
%Since the {\em compute} hosts were booted into an image that included the SLURM client
%components, the daemons should already be running on the {\em compute}
%hosts. 
Note that \SLURM{} leverages the use of the {\em munge} library to provide
authentication services and this daemon also needs to be running on all hosts
within the resource management pool. 
%The munge daemons should already
%be running on the {\em compute} subsystem at this point, 
The following commands can be used to startup the necessary services to support
resource management under \SLURM{}.
