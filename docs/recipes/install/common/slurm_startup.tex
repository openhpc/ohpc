In section \S\ref{sec:basic_install}, the \SLURM{} resource manager was installed
and configured for use on both the {\em master} host and {\em compute} node
instances. With the cluster nodes up and functional, we can now startup the
resource manager services in preparation for running user jobs. Generally, this
is a two-step process that requires starting up the controller daemons on the {\em
 master} host and the client daemons on each of the {\em compute} hosts.
%Since the {\em compute} hosts were booted into an image that included the SLURM client
%components, the daemons should already be running on the {\em compute}
%hosts. 
Note that \SLURM{} leverages the use of the {\em munge} library to provide
authentication services and this daemon also needs to be running on all hosts
within the resource management pool. 
%The munge daemons should already
%be running on the {\em compute} subsystem at this point, 
The following commands can be used to startup the necessary services to support
resource management under \SLURM{}.

% begin_ohpc_run
% ohpc_comment_header Resource Manager Startup \ref{sec:rms_startup}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,keywords={}]
# start munge and slurm controller on master host
[sms](*\#*) systemctl enable munge
[sms](*\#*) systemctl enable slurmctld
[sms](*\#*) systemctl start munge
[sms](*\#*) systemctl start slurmctld

# start slurm clients on compute hosts
[sms](*\#*) pdsh -w c[1-4] systemctl start slurmd
\end{lstlisting}
% end_ohpc_run

In the default configuration, the {\em compute} hosts will be initialized in an
{\em unknown} state. To place the hosts into production such that they are
eligible to schedule user jobs, issue the following:

% begin_ohpc_run
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
[sms](*\#*) scontrol update nodename=c[1-4] state=idle
\end{lstlisting}
% end_ohpc_run


% Additional recipe commands for additional computes.
