\OHPC{} provides multiple options for distributed resource management. The 
following command adds the \rms{} workload manager server components to the
chosen {\em master} host. Note that client-side components will be added to
the corresponding compute image in a subsequent step.

% begin_ohpc_run
% ohpc_comment_header Add resource management services on master node \ref{sec:add_rm}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,keywords={}]
[sms](*\#*) (*\install*) openpbs-server-ohpc
\end{lstlisting}
% end_ohpc_run

Other versions of this guide are available that describe installation of other
resource management systems, and they can be found in the \texttt{docs-ohpc}
package.
