In addition to the \OHPC{}
\iftoggle{isxCAT}{and \xCAT{} package repositories,}{package repository,}
the {\em master} host also requires access to the standard base OS distro
repositories in order to resolve necessary dependencies. For \baseOS{}, the
requirements are to have access to the BaseOS, Appstream, Extras, CRB,
and EPEL repositories for which mirrors are freely available online:

\begin{itemize*}
\item Rocky-9
  (e.g. \href{http://download.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/9/}
             {\color{blue}{http://download.rockylinux.org/pub/rocky/9/}} )
\item EPEL 9 (e.g. \href{http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/9/}
                        {\color{blue}{http://download.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/9/}} )
\end{itemize*}

\noindent The public EPEL repository will be enabled automatically upon
installation of the \texttt{ohpc-release} package. Note that this does depend
on the Rocky Extras repository, which is shipped with Rocky and is typically
enabled by default.  In contrast, the CRB repository is typically
disabled in a standard install, but can be enabled from EPEL as follows:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,literate={-}{-}1,keywords={},upquote=true]
[sms](*\#*) dnf -y install dnf-plugins-core
[sms](*\#*) dnf config-manager --set-enabled crb
\end{lstlisting}
