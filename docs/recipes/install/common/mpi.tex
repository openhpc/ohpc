For MPI development support, \OHPC{} presently provides pre-packaged builds for
three MPI families: 

\begin{itemize*}
\item MVAPICH2
\item OpenMPI
\item \Intel{}~MPI

\end{itemize*}
 For consistency, each of the open-source MPI families (OpenMPI and
 MVAPICH2) is built against each of the two supported compiler families
 resulting in total of four build combinations. The \Intel{} MPI stack is also
 configured to support both the \GNU{} and Intel compiler toolchain directly, but
 is packaged as a single RPM. Installation of all of the MPI family instances,
 can be accomplished via the following command. Note the use of wildcards
 (\texttt{*}) in this example in order to install both \GNU{} and Intel builds for
 OpenMPI and MVAPICH2. In addition to installing available MPI toolchains,
 the example below includes installation of a suite of pre-built MPI
 benchmarks (IMB) that are also provided via \OHPC{}.
