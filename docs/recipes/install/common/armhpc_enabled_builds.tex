In addition to the 3rd party development libraries built using the open source
toolchains mentioned in \S\ref{sec:3rdparty}, \OHPC{} also provides a subset of
{\em optional} compatible builds for use with the Arm Compiler for Linux.
These packages provide a similar hierarchical user environment experience as
other compiler families present in \OHPC{}.  To take advantage of the
available builds, the \OHPC{} variant of the Arm Compiler for Linux (and any
required licenses) must be downloaded and installed separately. See the
following for more information on obtaining this toolchain:

       {\color{blue}{https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/server-and-hpc/downloads/arm-allinea-studio/openhpc}}
\end{center}

As noted in \S\ref{sec:master_customization}, the default installation path for
\OHPC{} (\texttt{/opt/ohpc/pub}) is exported over NFS from the {\em master} to the 
compute nodes, but the Arm Linux compiler installer defaults to a path of 
\texttt{/opt/arm}. To make the Arm Linux compiler available to the compute 
nodes one must either customize the installation path to be 
within \texttt{/opt/ohpc/pub} (e.g. using the \texttt{-i /opt/ohpc/pub/arm}
option with the Arm installer), or alternatively, add an additional NFS export
for \texttt{/opt/arm} that is mounted on desired compute nodes.
\end{tcolorbox}
\end{center}

Once installed locally, the \OHPC{}
compatible packages can be installed using standard package manager semantics
after installation of a compatability package.
\noindent To enable all 3rd party builds available in \OHPC{} that are compatible with
Arm Linux Compiler, issue the following:
