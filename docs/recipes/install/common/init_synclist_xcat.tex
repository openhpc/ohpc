The \xCAT{} system includes functionality to distribute files from the SMS
server to the managed hosts. Here, this functionality is used to distribute user
credentials and to synchronize configuration files across the cluster.  To use
this feature, a \texttt{syncfile} listing files to be synchronized during the
provisioning process needs to be prepared. The location and the name are given
by the \texttt{\$syncfile} variable. Here, the file is created and content will
be added to it later. It will also be associated with an appropriate
\texttt{osimage} to make it active during the \xCAT{} provisioning process.
