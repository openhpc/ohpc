In addition to the \OHPC{} package repository, the {\em master} host also
requires access to the standard distro repositories in order to resolve
necessary dependencies. For \baseOS{}, the requirements are to have access to
both the base and SDK repositories. In addition, add-on modules are needed to
resolve dependencies for certain optional components. A summary of these 
requirements is as follows:

\begin{itemize*}
\item SLES12
\item SLES12-SDK
\item
  \href{https://www.suse.com/products/server/features/modules/}{\color{blue}{Web
      and Scripting Module}} (*only required for nagios/ganglia)
\item
  \href{http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/monitoring/SLE_12_SP4/}
       {\color{blue}{Server Monitoring Software}} (*only required for nagios/ganglia)
\item
