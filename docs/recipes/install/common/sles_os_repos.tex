In addition to the \OHPC{} package repository, the {\em master} host also
requires access to the standard distro repositories in order to resolve
necessary dependencies.

%%For \baseOS{}, the requirements are to have access to
%%both the base and SDK repositories. In addition, add-on modules are needed to
%%resolve dependencies for certain optional components. A summary of these
%%requirements is as follows:
%%
%%\begin{itemize*}
%%\item SLES12
%%\item SLES12-SDK
%%\item
%%  \href{http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/languages:/python:/backports/SLE_12_SP4/}
%%       {\color{blue}{Python development packages}} (*only required for Spack)
%%\item
