The \IntelR{} Cluster Checker provides a convenient suite of diagnostics that
can be used to aid in isolating hardware and software problems on an installed
cluster. This package can be optionally added to the SMS and compute image
using the commands below. Note that a valid license file will also need to be
installed in order to use this software (recall discussion in \S\ref{sec:byol}).
