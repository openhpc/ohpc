Prior to assembling the image, it is advantageous to perform any additional
customization within the chroot environment created for the desired {\em
 compute} instance. The following steps document the process to add a local
{\em ssh} key created by \Warewulf{} to support remote access, identify the
resource manager server, configure NTP for compute resources, and enable \NFS{}
mounting of a \$HOME file system and the public \OHPC{} install path
(\texttt{/opt/ohpc/pub}) that will be hosted by the {\em master} host in this
example configuration.
