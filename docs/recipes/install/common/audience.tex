\subsection{Target Audience}

This guide is targeted at experienced \Linux{} system administrators for HPC
environments. Knowledge of software package management, system networking, and
PXE booting is assumed. Command-line input examples are highlighted throughout
this guide via the following syntax:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,literate={-}{-}1,keywords={},upquote=true]
[sms](*\#*) echo "OpenHPC hello world"
\end{lstlisting}

Unless specified otherwise, the examples presented are executed with
elevated (root) privileges. The examples also presume use of the BASH login
shell, though the equivalent commands in other shells can be substituted.
In addition to specific command-line instructions called out in this guide, an
alternate convention is used to highlight potentially useful tips or optional
configuration options. These tips are highlighted via the following format:
