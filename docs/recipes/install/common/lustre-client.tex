To add \Lustre{} client support on the cluster, it necessary to install the client
and associated modules on each host needing to access a \Lustre{} file system. In
this recipe, it is assumed that the \Lustre{} file system is hosted by servers
that are pre-existing and are not part of the install process. Outlining the
variety of \Lustre{} client mounting options is beyond the scope of this document,
%(please consult \Lustre{} documentation for more details on failover configuration
%support and networking options), 
but the general requirement is to add a mount entry for the desired file system
that defines the management server (MGS) and underlying network transport
protocol. To add client mounts on both the {\em master} server and {\em
compute} image, the following commands can be used. Note that the \Lustre{} file
system to be mounted is identified by the \texttt{\$\{mgs\_fs\_name\}} variable. 
In this example, the file system is configured to be mounted locally
as \path{/mnt/lustre}.
