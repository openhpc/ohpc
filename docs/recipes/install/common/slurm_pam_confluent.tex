An additional optional customization that is recommended is to
restrict \texttt{ssh} access on compute nodes to only allow access by users who
have an active job associated with the node. This can be enabled via the use of
a pluggable authentication module (PAM) provided as part of the \SLURM{} package
installs. To enable this feature on {\em compute} nodes, issue the
following:

% begin_ohpc_run
% ohpc_validation_newline
% ohpc_validation_comment Enable slurm pam module
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,keywords={},upquote=true]
[sms](*\#*) nodeshell compute echo "\""account required pam_slurm.so"\"" \>\> /etc/pam.d/sshd
\end{lstlisting}
% end_ohpc_run
