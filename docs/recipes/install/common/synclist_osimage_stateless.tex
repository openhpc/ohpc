To make a \texttt{synclist} active, it needs to be associated with a prepared OS
image. The synchronization is then performed as the part of the provisioning
process when using the image.


The following associates the prepared \texttt{synclist} with the stateless \xCAT{} image:

% begin_ohpc_run
% ohpc_comment_header Import files \ref{sec:file_import}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,literate={-}{-}1,keywords={},upquote=true]
# Associate synclist with an osimage
[sms](*\#*) chdef -t osimage -o centos7.3-x86_64-netboot-compute synclists="$synclist"
\end{lstlisting}
% \end_ohpc_run
