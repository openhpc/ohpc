In addition to the 3rd party development libraries built using the open source
toolchains mentioned in \S\ref{sec:3rdparty}, \OHPC{} also provides {\em
  optional} compatible builds for use with the compilers and MPI stack included
in newer versions of the \IntelR{}~Parallel Studio XE software suite.  These
packages provide a similar hierarchical user
environment experience as other compiler and MPI families present in \OHPC{}.

To take advantage of the available builds, the Parallel Studio software suite
must be obtained and installed separately. Once installed locally, the \OHPC{}
compatible packages can be installed using standard package manager semantics.
Note that licenses are provided free of charge for many categories of use. In
particular, licenses for compilers and developments tools are provided at no
cost to academic researchers or developers contributing to open-source software
projects. More information on this program can be found at:

As noted in \S\ref{sec:master_customization}, the default installation path for
\OHPC{} (\texttt{/opt/ohpc/pub}) is exported over NFS from the {\em master} to the
compute nodes, but the Parallel Studio installer defaults to a path of
\texttt{/opt/intel}. To make the \IntelR{} compilers available to the compute
nodes one must either customize the Parallel Studio installation path to be
within \texttt{/opt/ohpc/pub}, or alternatively, add an additional NFS export
for \texttt{/opt/intel} that is mounted on desired compute nodes.

\IntelR{}~Parallel Studio, issue the following:
