The \texttt{wwmkchroot} process used in the previous step is designed to
provide a minimal \baseOS{} configuration. Next, we add additional components
to include resource management client services, NTP support, and
other additional packages to support the default \OHPC{} environment. This
process augments the chroot-based install performed by \texttt{wwmkchroot} to
modify the base provisioning image and will access the BOS and \OHPC{}
repositories to resolve package install requests.

To access the remote
repositories by hostname (and not IP addresses), the chroot environment needs
to be updated to enable DNS resolution. Assuming that the {\em master} host has
a working DNS configuration in place, the chroot environment can be updated
with a copy of the configuration as follows:

% begin_ohpc_run
% ohpc_comment_header Add OpenHPC components to compute image \ref{sec:add_components}
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,literate={-}{-}1,keywords={},upquote=true]
[sms](*\#*) cp -p /etc/resolv.conf $CHROOT/etc/resolv.conf
\end{lstlisting}
% end_ohpc_run

\noindent Now, we can include additional required components to the
compute instance including base components, resource manager client,
NTP, and development environment modules support.
