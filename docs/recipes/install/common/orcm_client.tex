To use the {\em in-band} method of collecting data from compute resources, the
\ORCM{} client daemon is required to be available on each compute node. This can
be added to the compute image as follows:

% begin_ohpc_run
% ohpc_validation_comment Install ORCM client on compute image
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash,keywords={},upquote=true]
[sms](*\#*) (*\groupchrootinstall*) ohpc-orcm-client

# Set master host as data aggregator
[sms](*\#*) perl -pi -e "s/aggregator_hostname/<sms_ip>/" $CHROOT/opt/open-rcm/etc/orcm-site.xml

# Enable orcmd client daemon on boot
[sms](*\#*) chroot $CHROOT systemctl enable orcmd
\end{lstlisting}
% end_ohpc_run
