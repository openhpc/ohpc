The installation, deployment and configuration of High Performance Computing
clusters is a rather tedious work.  There are various open source and
proprietary cluster management tools that attempt to provide a complete
solution to this problem.  In the open-source world the most widely known
solutions are Rocks and OSCAR.  Rocks \cite{rocks2003,rocks_url}, an open
source Linux-based cluster solution package, can significantly reduce the
complexity of building HPC clusters.  It provides a specific bundle of software
components covering the different administrative needs of a cluster and offers
an easy to use GUI for the different steps of the installation procedure.  All
cluster services and tools are installed and configured during the initial
installation of the frontend with no need to download and manual configure
other external packages. Furthermore, with the use of Rolls \cite{rolls2004}
the administrator can customize the base installation of packages with
additional software that integrate seamlessly and automatically into the
management and packaging mechanisms of the base software.
%It makes use of Kickstart and RPM to manage the distribution of node file
%system and provides component based configuration method to realize module
%reuse.
The latest and current stable version of Rocks, version 6.2, is based upon
CentOS 6.6.

OSCAR \cite{oscar2001,oscar_url} (Open Source Cluster Application Resources) is
fully integrated and easy to install software bundle designed for high
performance cluster computing. The fundamental function of OSCAR is to build
and maintain clusters.  OSCAR follows a different methodology than Rocks; once
the frontend is installed and booted, the cluster building components are
downloaded and installed through tools that try to simplify the complexity of
the different administrative tasks.  There have been some variations of OSCAR
based on the same framework to cover different types of cluster environments
such as Thin-Oscar for diskless platforms and HA-Oscar to support High
Availability. OSCAR is supported upon various Linux distributions such as
CentOS and Debian. However, even if OSCAR and its variations are still being
used in production, the project is no longer actively maintained and the latest
version 6.1.1 was released in 2011.
%OSCAR also provides a GUI for installation and configuration purposes.  OSCAR
%is based upon a virtual image of the target machine using System Installation
%Suite (SIS). There is also an OSCAR database (ODA) that stores cluster
%information, a parallel distributed “shell” tool set called C3 and an
%environment management facility called Env-Switcher.

OpenHPC is much less automated than Rocks, does not provide a GUI interface,
expects a certain expertise from the administrator, but it offers a greater
choice of software components, promoting flexibility, for each level of the
software stack. Furthermore OpenHPC is supported and maintained by a group of
vendors, research centers and laboratories that have as common goal
standardization through sharing of best practices.
