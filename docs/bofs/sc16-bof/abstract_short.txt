There is a growing sense within the HPC community for the need to have an open
community effort to more efficiently build, test, and deliver integrated HPC
software components and tools.  Formed initially in November 2015 and
formalized as a Linux Foundation project in June 2016, OpenHPC is endeavoring
to address this need.  At this BoF, speakers from the OpenHPC Technical
Steering committee will provide a technical overview of the project and
near-term roadmaps.  We then invite open discussion giving attendees an
opportunity to provide feedback on current conventions, packaging, request
additional components and configurations, and discuss general future trends.
