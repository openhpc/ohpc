.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
Inject files from the host into the Charliecloud image directory
\fBIMGDIR\fP\&.
.sp
The purpose of this command is to provide host\-specific files, such as GPU
libraries, to a container. It should be run after \fBch\-tar2dir\fP and
before \fBch\-run\fP\&. After invocation, the image is no longer portable to
other hosts.
.sp
Injection is not atomic; if an error occurs partway through injection, the
image is left in an undefined state. Injection is currently implemented using
a simple file copy, but that may change in the future.
.sp
By default, file paths that contain the string \fB/bin\fP are assumed to be
executables and are placed in \fB/usr/bin\fP within the container. File
paths that contain the strings \fB/lib\fP or \fB\&.so\fP are assumed to be
shared libraries and are placed in \fB/usr/lib\fP\&. Other files are placed in
the directory specified by \fB\-\-dest\fP\&.
.sp
If any of the files appear to be shared libraries, run \fBldconfig\fP inside
the container (using \fBch\-run \-w\fP) after injection.
.SH OPTIONS
.sp
To specify which files to inject:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-c\fP, \fB\-\-cmd CMD\fP
Inject files listed in the standard output of command \fBCMD\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-f\fP, \fB\-\-file FILE\fP
Inject files listed in the file \fBFILE\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-nvidia\fP
Use \fBnvidia\-container\-cli list\fP (from \fBlibnvidia\-container\fP)
to find executables and libraries to inject.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
These can be repeated, and at least one must be specified.
.sp
Additional arguments:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-dest DST\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Place files whose destination cannot be inferred in directory
\fBIMGDIR/DST\fP\&. If such a file is found and this option is not
specified, exit with an error.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
Print help and exit.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-no\-infer\fP
Do not infer the type of any files.
.TP
.B \fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-verbose\fP

.B \fB\-\-version\fP
Print version and exit.

.SH NOTES
.sp
Symbolic links are dereferenced, i.e., the files pointed to are injected, not
the links themselves.
.sp
As a corollary, do not include symlinks to shared libraries. These will be
re\-created by \fBldconfig\fP\&.
.sp
There are two alternate approaches for nVidia GPU libraries:
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
.INDENT 0.0
.IP 1. 3
Link \fBlibnvidia\-containers\fP into \fBch\-run\fP and call the
library functions directly. However, this would mean that Charliecloud
would either (a) need to be compiled differently on machines with and
without nVidia GPUs or (b) have \fBlibnvidia\-containers\fP available
even on machines without nVidia GPUs. Neither of these is consistent with
Charliecloud\(aqs philosophies of simplicity and minimal dependencies.
.IP 2. 3
Use \fBnvidia\-container\-cli configure\fP to do the injecting. This
would require that containers have a half\-started state, where the
namespaces are active and everything is mounted but \fBpivot_root(2)\fP
has not been performed. This is not feasible because Charliecloud has no
notion of a half\-started container.

.sp
Further, while these alternate approaches would simplify or eliminate this
script for nVidia GPUs, they would not solve the problem for other situations.
.SH BUGS
.sp
File paths may not contain newlines.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
Place shared library \fB/usr/lib64/libfoo.so\fP at path
\fB/usr/lib/libfoo.so\fP within the image \fB/var/tmp/baz\fP and
executable \fB/bin/bar\fP at path \fB/usr/bin/bar\fP\&. Then, create
appropriate symlinks to \fBlibfoo\fP and update the \fBld.so\fP cache.

.ft C
$ ch\-fromhost \-\-cmd \(aqcat qux.txt\(aq /var/tmp/baz
.ft P

Same as above, and also place file \fB/etc/quux\fP at \fB/etc/quux\fP
within the container:

.nf
.ft C
$ cat corge.txt

Inject the executables and libraries recommended by nVidia into the image, and
then run \fBldconfig\fP:
