%description
The Process Management Interface (PMI) has been used for quite some time as a
means of exchanging wireup information needed for interprocess communication. Two
versions (PMI-1 and PMI-2) have been released as part of the MPICH effort. While
PMI-2 demonstrates better scaling properties than its PMI-1 predecessor, attaining
rapid launch and wireup of the roughly 1M processes executing across 100k nodes
expected for exascale operations remains challenging.

PMI Exascale (PMIx) represents an attempt to resolve these questions by providing
an extended version of the PMI standard specifically designed to support clusters
up to and including exascale sizes. The overall objective of the project is not to
branch the existing pseudo-standard definitions - in fact, PMIx fully supports both
of the existing PMI-1 and PMI-2 APIs - but rather to (a) augment and extend those
APIs to eliminate some current restrictions that impact scalability, and (b) provide
a reference implementation of the PMI-server that demonstrates the desired level of
scalability.

This RPM contains all the tools necessary to compile and link against PMIx.
