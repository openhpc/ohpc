1.5.0 Release June 2013
    - Changes to Write API: 
      - adios_init() and adios_init_noxml() has MPI_Comm argument
      - adios_open() has MPI_comm argument instead of void * argument
    - Changes to Read API:
      - adios_read_open_stream() obsolete and now it's called
        adios_read_open() indicating that it's used for both
        files and staged data.

      - DIMES
      - FLEXPATH
    - CMAKE build files (besides Automake files)
    - New write method VAR_MERGE for spatial aggregation of

    - fix: endianness independence (
    - fix: in adios_inq_var_stat() for getting statistics (avg, std.dev)

           scalars over time (a 1D array)
