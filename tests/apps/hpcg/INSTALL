=================
Clone from GitHub
=================
The official HPCG repository is on GitHub.com.  You may fork the repository from here:

https://github.com/hpcg-benchmark/hpcg

===================
Download and Unpack (only if you did not clone from GitHub.com)
===================

Retrieve the tar-gzip file, from http://hpcg-benchmark.org

then uncompress it with:

    gunzip hpcg.tar.gz; tar -xvf hpcg.tar

this  will create  an ``hpcg`` directory, that  we call  the top-level directory
in the text below.

=============
Configuration
=============

HPCG uses a make-compatible file for configuring the compilers, linkers, and
their command line flags.

Create a file ``Make.<arch>`` in the ``setup`` directory right under the
top-level  directory. Suffix ``<arch>`` should be a name that you choose for
your system.  To make the process easier, you may want to re-use one of the
example files contained already in the ``setup`` directory.  The
``Make.<arch>`` file contains the command names of the compilers and linkers
together with their options for using special directories and linking with
libraries as well as their paths that are to be used for building the binary.

The most important variables that need to be set in ``Make.<arch>`` are:

* ``MPdir`` specifies the path to where the MPI installation resides. For some
  MPI implementations, using the MPI-enabled compiler (such as ``mpicxx``) is
  sufficient and it is not required specified any MPI installation paths. This
  variable can be used to setup the ``MPinc`` and ``MPlib`` variables.

* ``MPinc`` specifies the path to include directories with MPI header files. A
  common setting here would be ``MPinc = $(MPdir)/include``, provided that the
  ``MPdir`` variable was set properly.

* ``MPlib`` specifies the path to directories with MPI library files. A common
  setting here would be ``MPlib = $(MPdir)/lib``, provided that the ``MPdir``
  variable was set properly.

* ``HPCG_OPTS`` specifies additional compiler options for compiling the HPCG
  source files. These options might include optimization, debugging, or tuning
  flags.

* ``CXX`` specifies the name of the C++ compiler for compiling the code. It
  should be a C++ that supports a subset of STL that is used in HPCG as well as
  the subset of constructs used in the MPI standard.

* ``CXXFLAGS`` specifies the flags to be used when invoking the C++ compiler.
  These might include optimization and profiling options.

* ``LINKER`` specifies the linker capable of linking C++ programs that include
  MPI calls.

* ``LINKERFLAGS`` specifies the flags passed to the linker that might indicate
  directories where to look for standard C++ and MPI libraries.

HPCG supports in-source and out-of-source builds. In the case of the former,
the object files and the binary reside in the same directory structure as the
source files. There is no need for a seperate configuration step and the reader
may skip the the Build section.

In the latter case, a seperate directory is created to hold the object and
binary executable files.  For example, create a custom directory, ``build`` in
this example, for the results of compilation and linking::

    mkdir build

Next, go this new directory and use the ``configure`` script to create the
build infrastructure:

    cd build
    /path/to/hpcg/configure <arch>

Notice that you have to give a absolute or relative path to the ``configure``
shell script so that the location of the source files can be discovered
automatically. 

<arch> is the suffix of the setup file you created in the directory hpcg/setup.
Sample setup files are found in the hpcg/setup directory.

=====
Build
=====

For in-source builds, while in the top-level directory, simply type::

    make path/to/setup/file

For the out-of-source builds, go to the ``build`` directory and type ``make``.

In both cases, the executable called ``xhpcg`` should be created in the ``bin``
directory.

=============
Example Build
=============

As an example, let's use a Linux cluster and create a file called
``Make.Linux`` in the ``setup`` directory right under the top-level directory.

For in-source build, we type ``make setup/Make.Linux`` which creates the executable
file called ``bin/xhpcg``.

For out-of-source build, we create the build directory called ``build_Linux``
and go to that direcotry::

    mkdir build_Linux
    cd build_Linux

Then, while in the ``build_Linux`` directory we type::

    /path/to/hpcg/configure Linux
    make

This creates the executable file ``bin/xhpcg``.

====
Test
====

For a quick check, go to the ``bin`` directory and run the HPCG executable as
follows::

    mpirun -np 8 xhpcg

Note that this will use the default ``hpcg.dat`` file. If you'd like to change
the size of local dimensions of the problem to NX=32, NY=24, NZ=16 then run the
following::

    mpirun -np 8 xhpcg 32 24 16

You can also specific size and runtime parameters using --nx, --ny, --nz, --rt.
For example, for specifying the local grid dimensions to be NX=NY=NZ=16, and
the timed phase execution limit of 30 minutes (1800 seconds) you can use

    mpirun -np 4 xhpcg --nx=16 --rt=1800


======
Tuning
======

Most of the performance  parameters can be tuned by modifying the input file
``hpcg.dat``. See the file ``TUNING`` in the top-level directory.


====================
Compile Time Options
====================

At the end of the "model" ``Make.<arch>``, the  user  is given the opportunity to
compile the software with some specific compile options.  The list of this
options and their meaning are:

* Compile with modest debugging turned on::

    -DHPCG_DEBUG

* Compile with voluminous debugging information turned on::

    -DHPCG_DETAILED_DEBUG

* Compile with MPI disabled::

    -DHPCG_NO_MPI

* Compile without OpenMP enabled::

    -DHPCG_NO_OPENMP

* Enable detail timers::

    -DHPCG_DETAILED_TIMING


By default HPCG will:

* Turn on MPI support.
* Turn on OpenMP support.
* not display detailed timing information.
