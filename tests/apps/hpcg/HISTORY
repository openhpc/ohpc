===============
History of HPCG
===============

-----------
Version 2.4
-----------

* Fixed (again) the FLOP count for DDOT and WAXPBY.  We forgot that the 
  preamble is called many times.

-----------
Version 2.3
-----------

* Fixed the FLOP count for DDOT and WAXPBY.  The operations in the preamble were
  not being accounted for.

-----------
Version 2.2
-----------

* Reduced the penalty for optimization overhead by a factor of 10 (amortized over 10
  sets of 50 reference iterations.
* Fixed a bug that did not account for increased iterations that can occur with
  multicoloring reorderings.
* Fixed numerous other small bugs reported by HPCG users.

-----------
Version 2.1
-----------

* Fixed a small but important bug in ComputeProlongation_ref.cpp (- sign should be + sign).

-----------
Version 2.0
-----------

* Added support for a synthetic multigrid V cycle.  Parameters include
  the number of levels in the the grid hierarchy, number of pre and
  post smoother steps.
* Refactored data classes to support needs for recursion in V cycle.
* Made simple modifications to make compilation on MS Windows easier.
  This includes changing the format of output files to remove colons.

-----------
Version 1.1
-----------

* Added a simple code for users remove in order to indicate whether
optimization was done for dot-product, SPMV, SYMGS, or WAXPBY.
* Fixed a problem with computing the variance of results from multiple runs.

-----------
Version 1.0
-----------

* Changed the diagonal entry from 27 to 26 to influence convergence rate.
* Changed license file (COPYRIGHT) from 4-clause BSD (original BSD) to 3-clause
BSD (modified BSD)
* Added a line to the input file (hpcg.dat) that allows to specify time to run
the benchmark.

-----------
Version 0.5
-----------

* Improved the formula used for scaling of departure of symmetry

-----------
Version 0.4
-----------

* Fixed bugs in integer computations where intermediate 32-bit
  integer computations resulted in values that exceeded the
  32-bit range and gave incorrect results.
* Fixed the computation of the number of CG set runs to take
  into account varying timing results across MPI processes.

-----------
Version 0.3
-----------

* Given out to friendly testers.
* Includes Doxygen output.
* Numerous small changes.
* Substantially improved output.
* Tested on large systems.

-----------
Version 0.2
-----------
* Given out to "friends".
* Numerous small changes.


-----------
Version 0.1
-----------

* Added local symmetric Gauss-Seidel preconditioning.
* Changed global geometry to be true 3D.  Previously was a beam (subdomains
  were stacked only in the z dimension).
* Introduced three global/local index modes: 32/32, 64/32, 64/64 to handle all
  problem sizes.
* Changed execution strategy to perform multiple runs with just a few
  iterations per run.
* Added infrastructure and rules for user adaptation of kernels for performance
  optimization.
* Added benchmark modification and reporting rules.
* Changed directory and file layout to mimic HPL layouts where appropriate.

History of HPCCG
================

--------------------------
NAME CHANGE: HPCCG to HPCG
--------------------------

* The name was changed from HPCCG to HPCG without any code changes.

-----------
Version 1.0
-----------

* Released as part of Mantevo Suite 1.0, December 2012.

-----------
Version 0.5
-----------

* Added timing for Allreduce calls in MPI mode, printing min/max/avg times.
* Set the solver tolerance to zero to make all solves take ``max_iter``
  iterations.
* Changed accumulator to a local variable for ``ddot``.  It seems to help
  dual-core performance.

-----------
Version 0.4
-----------

- Made total_nnz a "long long" so that MFLOP numbers were valid
  when the nonzero count is  more than 2^31.

-----------
Version 0.3
-----------

* Fixed a performance bug in ``make_local_matrix.cpp`` that was very noticeable
  when the fraction of off-processor grid points was large.

-----------
Version 0.2
-----------

* Fixed bugs related to turning MPI compilation off.
* Added more text to README to improve understanding.
* Added new ``Makfile.x86linux.gcc`` for non-opteron systems.
* Made ``MPI_Wtime`` the default timer when in MPI mode.

-----------
Version 0.1
-----------

HPCCG (Original version) was written as a teaching code for illustrating the
anatomy of a distributed memory parallel sparse iterative solver for new
research students and junior staff members.  March 2000.
