NOTE: The instructions in this file assume you are working with a version
      of the software from the HPCG repository, or have already unpacked
      the hpcg distribution tar file. We assume you are in the main hpcg 
      directory.

1) Review the collection of setup files in 'hpcg/setup'.  Determine which of
   these files is usable for your system, or create a new file of your own
   with appropriate parameters, starting from an existing file if you like.
   Note the suffix of the file Make.suffix (e.g., Make.MPI_GCC_OpenMP has the
   suffix MPI_GCC_OpenMP).

   Example commands: 
      ls setup
      cp setup/Make.MPI_GCC_OMP setup/Make.My_MPI_OMP
      vi setup/Make.My_MPI_OMP

2) Create a build directory under the main hpcg directory (or somewhere else on
   your system).  Give the directory a meaningful name such as 'My_MPI_OpenMP'.

   Example command:
      mkdir My_MPI_OpenMP

3) 'cd' to your build directory, and run the configure command located in the
   main hpcg directory, defining the path and file argument to be the location
   of the setup file defined in step 1.  Then run 'make'.

   Example commands:
      cd My_MPI_OpenMP
      path_to_hpcg/configure My_MPI_OMP
      make

4) If make is successful, you will have a 'bin' directory containing the files
   'hpcg.dat' and 'xhpcg'.  'cd' to the bin directory and run the benchmark.

   Example commands:
      cd bin
      export OMP_NUM_THREADS 4
      mpiexec -np 64 ./xhpcg

5) The benchmark has completed execution. This should take a few minutes
   when running in evaluation mode, and take about 30 minutes in official
   benchmark mode. If you are running on a production system, you may be able
   to submit results using the Quick Path option, which executes in minimum time.
   When the run is complete, you will see a file called 
   'HPCG-Benchmark[version]_[timestamp].yaml'.  You will also see a log file
   called 'hpcg_log_[timestamp].txt.  The official results from your run are
   in the .yaml file.  The final two lines of the file declare whether or not
   the results are valid, and explain how to report them.

   Example commands:
      less HPCG-Benchmark-1.1_2014:01:22-22:46:06.yaml

6) If results are valid, you may upload them to http://hpcg-benchmark.org.
   If results are not valid, do not submit them.
