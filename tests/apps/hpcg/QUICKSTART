NOTE: The instructions in this file assume you are working with a version
      of the software from the HPCG repository, or have already unpacked
      the hpcg distribution tar file. We assume you are in the main hpcg 
      directory.

1) Review the collection of setup files in hpcg/setup.  Determine which of
   these files is usable for your system, or create a new file of your own
   with appropriate parameters, starting from an existing file if you like.
   Note the suffix of the file Make.suffix (e.g., Make.MPI_GCC_OpenMP has the
   suffix MPI_GCC_OpenMP).

   Example commands: 
      ls setup
      cp setup/Make.MPI_GCC_OMP setup/Make.My_MPI_OMP
      vi setup/Make.My_MPI_OMP

2) Create a build directory under the main hpcg directory (or somewhere else on
   your system).  Give the directory a meaningful name such as MPI_GCC_OpenMP.

   Example command:
      mkdir My_MPI_OMP_BUILD

3) 'cd' to your build directory, and run the configure command located in the
   main hpcg directory, defining the path and file argument to be the location
   of the setup file defined in step 1.  Then run 'make'.

   Example commands:
      cd My_MPI_OMP_BUILD
      ../configure ../setup/Make.My_MPI_OMP
      make

4) If make is successful, you will have a bin directory containing the files
   hpcg.dat and xhpcg.  'cd' to the bin directory and run the benchmark.

   Example commands:
      cd bin
      export OMP_NUM_THREADS 4
      mpiexec -np 64 ./xhpcg

5) The benchmark has completed execution. This should take a few minutes
   when running in evaluation mode, and take more than 5 hours in official
   benchmark mode. When the run is complete, you will see a file called 
   'benchmark-hpcg-[version]_[timestamp].yaml'.  You will also see a log file
   called 'hpcg_log_[timestamp].txt.  The official results from your run are
   in the .yaml file.  The final two lines of the file declare whether or not
   the results are valid, and explain how to report them.

   Example commands:
      less HPCG-Benchmark-1.1_2014:01:22-22:46:06.yaml
      mail hpcg-results@software.sandia.gov < HPCG-Benchmark-1.1_2014:01:22-22:46:06.yaml

6) If results are not valid, do not submit them.
