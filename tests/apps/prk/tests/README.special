******************************************************************

This files contains instructions for building and running PRKs using
the Charm++, OpenSHMEM, Grappa, or Fine-Grain MPI runtimes.

These runtimes need to be  installed, and you need to specify in file
PRKROOT/common/make.defs where they are located. Note that if Charm++,
OpenSHMEM or Grappa are built on top of MPI, MPI does need to be
installed, even if it is not called directly.

Grappa
------
This runtime requires cmake to install. Compile and link flags
depend on the particulars of the installation and cannot be specified
uniformly. Hence, it may be necessary to obtain them from the Grappa
installation, after building it, from GRAPPAROOT/util/grappa.mk and
insert 	      them into the required Makefile associated with each PRK.
The run script grappa(s)_run may not give the desired result. If
Grappa is built to use MPI, the code can be run in most cases by using
mpiexec.hydra, with the usual command line parameters.

Charm++
-------
The run script charmrun may not give the desired result. If Charm++
is built to use MPI, the code can be run in most cases by using
mpiexec.hydra, with the usual command line parameters.

Fine-Grain MPI
--------------
Care must be taken to use the specific MPI version supporting this
runtime, which must be built explicitly. Codes are run using the
Fine-Grain MPI version of mpiexec.hydra. This name may well clash
with the version of mpiexec.hydra supporting standard MPI. Such a
conflict may be avoided by starting a sub-shell for FG_MPI runs and
changing path variables only inside that shell. Scripts in the
PRKROOT/Run directory employ this technique automatically and do
not need to be modified for proper execution.
