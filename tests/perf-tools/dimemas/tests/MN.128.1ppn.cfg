 * 
 * The records here described follow the SDDF file defintio. Each field must be
 * sepparated by commas in the actual records.
 *
 * The basic types are self-descriptive. When the field type correspond to an
 * array (<type>[]), the structure of the values must be in this format:
 *
 * [array_length] { value_1, value_2, ..., value_array_lenght }
